ABOUT

Export events from Oracle Calendar into a .ics file to allow 
Google Calendar, Apple's iCal, or any tool that reads .ics 
files, to subscribe to them. These utilities DO NOT PROVIDE 
SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICES. They only provide-read only access 
to Oracle Calendar data, but that's better than no access.


SYNOPSIS

  ocal_parse.pl --config-file /path/to/config > $HOME/Sites/calendar.ics

  ocal_export --hostname host \
      --username user \
      --password password \
      --begin YYYYMMDD \
      --end YYYYMMDD | local_parse.pl > /path/to/public_html/calendar.ics

NOTE: Contrary to the Oracle Collaboration Suite SDK notes, 
the library OracleCalendarSDK.bundle must be in the CURRENT
working directory in order for the exporter to work. 
ocal_parse.pl handles this for you when it is configured 
from a config file as shown above. A sample config file,
ocal_export.config, is included with the distribution.

NOTE THAT THE CONFIG FILE MUST CONTAIN YOUR ORACLE CALENDAR 
PASSWORD IN PLAIN TEXT. This is necessary in order to authenticate
to the Oracle Calendar server. Take pains to restrict access 
to this file and make sure it is not accessible except to the
account that owns it. 

The following crontab entry will run this script Monday-Friday
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 15 minutes past the hour, writing the 
results to a file in your Web Sharing directory: 

  15 8-18 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/ocal_parse.pl --config-file $HOME/ocal_export.config 2>/dev/null > $HOME/Sites/oracle_calendar.ics

Use the following URL to subscribe using iCal: 

  http://localhost/~your_user_name/oracle_calendar.ics


INSTALL

  make
  sudo make install
  
This installs the Oracle Calendar exporter (ocal_export)
and export-parse script (ocal_parse.pl) in /usr/local/bin, 
libraries in /usr/local/lib and headers in /usr/local/include.


CAVEATS

The OracleCalendarSDK.bundle must be in the CURRENT
WORKING DIRECTORY for ocal_export to run, not the 
directory containing ocal_export, as stated in the SDK
instructions. 

ocal_export occassionally segfaults (EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV), 
KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS) on intel macs. Certain date spans will
reliably cause the explosion for a while, then stop exploding
when events are added or deleted. ocal_parse.pl works around 
the problem by shifting the date span when it detects a failure;
the constant FETCH_RETRY determines how many times to retry.
